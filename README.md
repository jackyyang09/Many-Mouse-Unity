# Disclaimer
**I have since released a better starting implementation of [multiple mouse devices in Unity](https://github.com/jackyyang09/Multi-Mouse-Unity). As such, I will not be updating this project any longer. This repo will be left up for archival purposes.**

# Overview
ManyMouseUnity is a Unity implementation of a C# port of [ManyMouse](https://icculus.org/manymouse/) whose purpose is to finally make using multiple mouse input devices in Unity possible.

# Getting Started
1. Download the latest release package from [here](https://github.com/jackyyang09/Many-Mouse-Unity/releases).
2. Import the package contents into your Unity project
3. Check out the Examples folder for ways of integrating ManyMouse in your project
4. Make sure to add `using ManyMouseUnity;` at the top of your files when using ManyMouseUnity in your scripts

# Credits 
This Unity package is an extension of a Unity C# port and implementation of ManyMouse by [Aubrey Hesselgren](https://github.com/HilariousCow) who shared his work on [a blogpost showcasing another implementation of RawInput in Unity for the purposes of multiple mouse input](https://alastaira.wordpress.com/2015/08/04/multiple-mice-input-in-unity/). Unlike ManyMouse, I was never able to get RawInputSharp to work.

[ManyMouse was originally created by Ryan C. Gordon](https://github.com/icculus/manymouse)
